//! The bounded rig: everything a model can see, say, or do.
//!
//! [`tools`] is the whole of that surface. Four tools, each one a typed Rig
//! [`Tool`](rig_agent::tool::Tool), and nothing else reaches the outside world
//! on the model's behalf.
//!
//! The property the module exists to hold is a separation of two channels that
//! look alike from inside a tool and are not alike at all. A tool's *arguments*
//! are authored by the model; a tool's *context* is authored by the host. Which
//! workspace is being repaired, whether the attempt is still live, and which
//! program the check runs are all host facts, so they travel through
//! [`ToolHost`](tools::ToolHost) in Rig's
//! [`ToolContext`](rig_agent::tool::ToolContext) — never as a field of an
//! `Args` struct, and never in an advertised JSON schema. A schema is a menu:
//! anything named on it is something the model may fill in, and a workspace root
//! the model may fill in is not a workspace root at all.
