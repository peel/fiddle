# Backlog

<!-- Ideas, technical debt, someday/maybe items. Cross-cutting — covers both
     product and technical concerns. Append-only with dates.
     
     Periodically review: promote to beans, delete, or leave.
     Agents can suggest additions here during brainstorming.
     Agents should read this before planning to avoid re-discovering known items. -->

### 2026-04-02 — Skill size estimates are unreliable for verbatim extraction
Design spec predicted 12KB for develop-loop; actual was 20.5KB (71% over). JSON examples, code blocks, and HARD-GATE blocks are denser than prose and harder to estimate. Future specs involving skill extraction should measure the source line range directly rather than estimating.

### 2026-07-28 — PR-review feedback channel into calibration/antipattern memory
Harvest human review comments from finish-branch PRs back into calibration and antipattern files, /iterate-style, closing the reviewer-to-memory loop that only the attended gate feeds today. Deferred from epic fiddle-sip9 (one loop at a time).

### 2026-07-28 — Scheduled antipattern-eradication maintenance loop
Scheduled CI workflow that consumes deliver's antipattern files: a script scans the codebase for occurrences, one is picked per run, a coding agent fixes it and opens a PR, at most one PR open at a time, human merges. Continuous cleanup between epics, complementary to develop-loop. Deferred from epic fiddle-sip9.

### 2026-07-29 — check-convergence.sh budget-count convention and double-pass headroom
The budget check runs before verdict evaluation, so post-dispatch counts flag DISPATCHES_EXCEEDED for a completed passing run; a pass on iteration N can never confirm within budget N. Decide pre-dispatch counting explicitly and set defaults with double-pass headroom.
Origin: implementation (epic fiddle-sip9, hit at both per-task and holistic budgets)

### 2026-07-29 — Holistic scorecard shape vs merge-scorecards input
holistic-scorecard-schema.md's example (top-level domain/dimensions, no criteria array) does not match merge-scorecards.sh expectations (domains wrapper + criteria required); the wrapping step is unspecified and lives in orchestrator judgment. Specify the shape or add a wrapper.
Origin: implementation (epic fiddle-sip9 holistic phase, fails loud exit 2 since the criteria validation)

### 2026-07-29 — develop-loop 1f wording and per-domain selected-provider files
Reword 1f's "the evaluator may interact with the running app" to match the interpret-only role, and name selection output selected-provider-{domain}.json so multi-domain PASS_PENDING reuse reads the right provider.

### 2026-07-29 — patsub_replacement mangles ampersands in dispatch payloads
On bash 5.2+ with patsub_replacement, "&" in --diff-file/--evidence-file content is rewritten to the placeholder text during PROMPT substitution in dispatch-provider.sh. Quote the replacement or use a temp-free jq substitution.
Origin: code-review (fiddle-im2e confirming evaluation; pre-existing, affects --diff-file too)

### 2026-07-30 — Three debug reference files were pointed at but never written
skills/debug/SKILL.md referenced root-cause-tracing.md, defense-in-depth.md, and condition-based-waiting.md, none of which have ever existed in skills/debug/. The pointers were dropped and their one-line substance folded into the surrounding prose; if backward call-stack tracing, layered validation, or condition-based waiting deserve full treatments, they need writing rather than referencing.
